# Dirhash_fast

**Dirhash_fast**<br>
is a high-performance Rust tool designed to quickly compute cryptographic hashes (Blake3) of entire directory trees.
It supports parallel processing to scale effectively to large datasets, and works cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
It is much faster than the crate dirhash, and meant to be used more easily than merkle_hash.
Dirhash_fast can be used both as a standalone command-line application and as a library in Rust projects. <br>
**Usage (binary)**:<br>
Run `dirhash /path/to/directory` to print the hash of the specified directory.<br>
**Usage (library)**:<br>Include <br>`dirhash = "0.1"`<br> in your project's `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`.<br>
Example usage in Rust: <br>
`use dirhash::hash_directory;
fn main() { 
    let hash = hash_directory("/path/to/directory".as_ref());
    println!("Directory hash: {}", hash); 
    }`.<br>
**Installation**: From source: `cargo install --path .`, or from crates.io: `cargo install dirhash`.
**License**: Dirhash is dual-licensed under either Apache-2.0 or MIT, at your option.
